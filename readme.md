# Onirim

## Setup

Shuffle the 76 cards from the basic game (the cards without expansion symbols):
this is the deck that represents the labyrinth to be explored.

Draw your opening hand of cards: draw the top 5 cards from the top of the deck.
If you draw any Door or Dream cards, set them aside, and replace them with the
top card of the deck, until you have 5 Location cards in hand. Then, re-shuffle
all cards set aside back into the deck.

### The Limbo Pile

During the game, some effects may cause you to shuffle cards back in the deck.
Put these cards aside temporarily in an area called the Limbo pile; at the end
of each turn, all cards in the Limbo pile are shuffled back into the deck.

> Example: the player draws 5 cards: 3 Location cards, 1 Dream card, and 1 Door
> card. He sets aside the Dream and the Door cards into the Limbo pile, and
> draws 2 replacement cards: 1 Location card and another Door card.

> He sets the other Door card aside, and draws another replacement card: it's a
> Location card. He now has 5 Location cards in hand; he shuffles the Limbo
> pile (i.e. the 3 cards set aside) into the deck.

## Game Play

A turn is divided into three phases:

1. Play or discard a card
2. Fill your hand
3. Shuffle the Limbo pile

### Play or Discard a card

#### Play a card

Initiate (if it's the first round) or continue (for the rest of the game) the
row of cards which represents the part of the labyrinth you are exploring (the
Labyrinth row), by playing one Location card from your hand face up in front of
you.

The card should be played in such a way that the previously played card remains
partly visible. There is one golden rule: the card played may not have any
symbol in common with the last card played.

There are three symbols: Sun, Moon and Key.

> Discovering a Door card: If the card just played is the third in a row of the
> same color, you obtain a Door card of that color: you may search this card in
> the deck, then place it on the table in front of you, and shuffle the deck.

> Important: If a card is the fourth in a row of the same color, it counts as
> the first card of a new series of that same color.

#### Discard a card

Choose a card from your hand and discard it onto the discard pile. If it is a
Moon or Sun card, go to phase 2 "Complete your hand".

If the discarded card is a Key card, you trigger a Prophecy, after which you go
to phase 2.

> Prophecy: look at the top 5 cards of the deck, discard one of them (this is
> mandatory), and put the 4 remaining cards back on top of the deck in the
> order of your choice.

> Note: if there are less than 5 cards remaining in the deck, reveal all those
> cards, discard one of them , and put the remaining cards back in the order of your choice.

### Fill your Hand

You must replenish your hand to five cards, by drawing the top card from the
deck.

There are three possibilities:

1. It is a Location card. This card simply replaces the card just played or
discarded this turn.

2. It is a Door card. You may immediately discard from your hand a Key card of
the same color. If you do, you obtain the Door card and place it in front of
you.
If you do not have a Key of the same color or do not want to use the Key, place
the Door card in the Limbo pile

3. It is a Dream card. You have to resolve the effect of this card immediately.

If you have 5 cards in your hand, go to phase 3 "Shuffle the Limbo pile".
Otherwise, continue to replenish your hand and draw the top card from the deck.

> Note: if you have less than 4 cards, you draw - and, if necessary, resolve -
> one card after the other.

#### Resolve a Dream card

In the basic game, there is only one type of Dream card: the Nightmare.

When you draw a Nightmare card, you have to choose one of the following four
options:

1. Discard a Key card from your hand.

2. Place one of your gained Door cards in the Limbo pile.

3. Reveal the top 5 cards from the deck: discard all those cards, except Door
and/ or Dream cards, which are placed into the Limbo pile.

4. Discard your whole hand and draw a new hand of 5 cards, using the method
described for the beginning of the game: draw cards until you have 5 Location
cards in your hand, putting aside any Door and/or Dream card into the Limbo
pile (the Dream cards are not resolved, and you cannot obtain a Door card by
discarding a Key card).

Once the Nightmare card has been resolved, discard it.

### Shuffle the Limbo Pile

Shuffle all cards set aside in the Limbo pile back into the deck. If no cards
were put in the Limbo this turn, skip this step: there is no phase 3 this turn.

The turn is then over. Play one turn after another until the end of the game.

## End of the Game

* Victory: You win if, at any point, all 8 Door cards are in play at the same
time. The game ends immediately (you don't have to replenish your hand).

* Defeat: You lose if you must draw a card to fill you hand, and there is no
card left in the deck.
